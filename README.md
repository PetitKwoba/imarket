This repository now includes a minimal React + Vite scaffold (local files only) with a sleek navigation bar component.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then open the address shown by the dev server (usually http://localhost:5173).

Files added:
- `package.json` - project manifest and scripts for vite.
- `index.html` - app entry HTML.
- `src/main.jsx` - React entry, mounts App.
- `src/App.jsx` - top-level app, includes the NavBar.
- `src/components/NavBar.jsx` - the requested navigation bar with menu items.
- `src/index.css` - global and nav styles.

If you want I can also run `npm install` and start the dev server for you, or convert this to Create React App instead of Vite.
